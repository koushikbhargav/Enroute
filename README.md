# Enroute

Economic inequality is one of the major crises that we are facing today.  Especially in developing countries the need for money is making th poverty-stricken communities to move out of their native places into cities. This is one of the major reasons why we have urban poverty. Job providing agencies exploit the need of workers in these communities and make a great amount of corrupt money. 

nroute is a transparent and balanced platform to connect individual job providers with workers. Our platform mainly focuses on low-wage and temporary jobs. We also developed a payments protocol that will incentivize the Sponsors / Job providers to hire workers through our platform.
